This app is all about tracking and achieve your financial goals or saving. 
In today's people do have more than 1 bank accounts not even in the same bank but also in others,
 so our goal is to connect all those bank accounts and give you one virtual account which will tell you about 
the total amount you have in all the accounts. And we will show a dashboard having an insight type functionality 
which will show you where did you spend money today or yesterday or any in a specific week or month. Will tell you 
where did you spend that money on that day. As said to achieve your financial goals, we will also set a reminder,
that reminder will be according to your goal, like your bank account has 100K, and you want to save 20K at the end of 
the month, so whenever your account balance reached 20k it will give you a reminder call or message to alert you that 
you have touched the limit of this month.
